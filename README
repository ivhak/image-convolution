Image Convolution Example
-------------------------

Implementation of a general image convolution algorithm, based on code written
for an assignment in the course TDT4200 Parallel Computing at NTNU Trondheim,
Fall 2020.

Implementations in CUDA, HIP, OpenCL and plain, serial C. All implementations
take a bitmap image and apply a number of iterations with a given convolution
kernel (see Usage).

Building
--------

CUDA:

    make cuda

HIP:

    make hip

OpenCL:

    make opencl


Serial:

    make serial


Tools
-----

There are also some tools included in src/tools:

- `bmpdiff` checks whether two bitmap images are equal and creates a diff if
  they are not. The diff is simply a new bitmap image where the differing pixels
  are set to (255,0,0) (red).

- `bmptile` takes an input bitmap image and tiles it X times in the width
  direction and Y times in the height direction to create a larger image.

The tools can be built by running

    make tools


Data
----

An example bitmap image can be found in data/before.bmp. Larger images for benchmarking
can easily be created with `bmptile`.

Filters
-------

The following filters/kernels are defined in lib/filter.h, and the one to be used can
be specified with the -k flag:
 - SobelY        (-k 0)
 - SobelX        (-k 1)
 - Lalplacian 1  (-k 2)
 - Lalplacian 2  (-k 3)
 - Lalplacian 3  (-k 4)
 - Gaussian      (-k 5)


Usage
-----

    ./image_convolution_[cuda|hip|opencl|serial] [options] <input-bmp> <output-bmp>

    Options:
      -k, --filter     <filter>        filter index (0<=x<=5) (2)
      -i, --iterations <iterations>    number of iterations (1)

    Example: ./image_convolution_[cuda|hip|opencl|serial] data/before.bmp after.bmp -i 10000
